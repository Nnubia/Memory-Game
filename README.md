# Memory Game Project


## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## My Note

The Memory game is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a pack of 16 cards and a user must match them accordingly. The timer lets the user know how long it took to complete the game. The star rating lets a user know his capapbility in the game. The rating is calculated by the number of moves made.

The Memory game runs on any browser and on any device with internet connection. To play, open the index.html file in a browser and click the card to flip it.

The reset button helps the user rest the game anytime even when the game has begun.
